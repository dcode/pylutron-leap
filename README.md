NOTE: Thiscode WILL NOT work to integrate your stuff into home assistant or anything else at the moment. It is intended to develop python against LEAP devices and explore what is possible. Please don't ask how you can use it to get your devices to work, because it's just not there.

See [scratchpad.ipynb](scratchpad.ipynb) for notes for now.
